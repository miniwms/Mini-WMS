üö® **Important:** To successfully import the orders with their items, you need to have the Amazon SellerSKU field on Amazon, the same as the item number in your mini-WMS app.

# **Excel Import**:  
- You need to fill in two sheets:  
  - One for sales order headers.  
  - One for sales order details.  
    
Each method provides flexibility to suit your operational needs and streamline sales order processing.

To import sales orders via excel, click on the "Get Orders from excel" button and upload your Excel spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet should consist of two sheets: "salesorder" and "salesorderline". The import process will look for these sheet names with exact spelling.
So it needs to be written as they are. Below are the excel sheets and their columns.

The salesorder spreadsheet columns should contain the first row as the column names of the sales order header fields, then, in the next rows the header information, as shown below:
In this case we have shown 2 orders. You can have as many as you like.

```
"salesorder"
