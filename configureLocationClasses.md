# Location classes or location groups

Location classes are a way to categorize or group multiple storage locations within a warehouse based on shared characteristics.

Each location class can represent a group of bins or shelves that share common attributes, such as:

- **Storage Type**: Grouping locations based on the type of items they store, like computers, computer accessories, heavy goods, small parts, or hazardous materials.
- **Accessibility**: Classifying locations by how easily they can be accessed, e.g., prime locations for fast-moving items.
- **Temperature Control**: Designating areas for climate-controlled goods (e.g., refrigerated locations).
- **Load Capacity**: Differentiating locations that can bear certain weight limits.
