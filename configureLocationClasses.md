# Location classes or location groups

Location classes are a way to categorize or group multiple storage locations within a warehouse based on shared characteristics.

Each location class can represent a group of bins or shelves that share common attributes, such as:

- **Storage Type**: Grouping locations based on the type of items they store, like computers, computer accessories, heavy goods, small parts, or hazardous materials.
- **Accessibility**: Classifying locations by how easily they can be accessed, e.g., prime locations for fast-moving items.
- **Temperature Control**: Designating areas for climate-controlled goods (e.g., refrigerated locations).
- **Load Capacity**: Differentiating locations that can bear certain weight limits.

- Click the Location class button, the next screen will display the list of existing location classes in order of location class numbers.
- You can add new location class by using the + button from the location class result screen.
- Specify if the new location class is dedicated or not. This will make sure that any location in this location class will be dedicated, even when stock goes to zero the itemloc will be deleted from the system. Otherwise, if this dedicate flag if off, then if stock goes to zero then the itemloc get deleted from the system, the location is made available again by setting it's empty flag to 'Y'.
