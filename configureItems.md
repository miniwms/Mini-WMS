# Configure item types and items/SKUs

Item types and SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) are critical elements in a Warehouse Management System (WMS). Properly defining these ensures efficient warehouse operations and seamless inventory management.

By setting up item types and SKUs effectively, your warehouse operations become more organized and efficient, resulting in reduced errors, faster processing times, and improved inventory control.

SKUs are unique identifiers assigned to each individual item or product. SKUs are essential for:

- Inventory Tracking.
- Order Fulfillment.
