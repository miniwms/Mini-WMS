# Data and Credentials/Token Deletion Information:

All access to external services like Amazon, eBay, or Shopify is performed through secure, user-provided credentials (such as OAuth tokens, API keys, or other authentication credentials).

All of your data, including API credentials and customer information, is stored securely and exclusively on your device. You can disconnect services and delete stored credentials at any time within the app's settings, and all data is permanently removed upon uninstallation.


**All data, tokens, and credentials are stored securely within the app on the user's device.**  
No personally identifiable information (PII), authentication tokens, or store data is transmitted to or stored on any external server controlled by the app developer.

## How to delete your data

- You can remove access to your store at any time from the app "Setup -> System parameters" page, by deleting all the OAuth/credentials & Token fields.
- To delete all data, simply go to the "App info" under you phone Settings on your device, then go to Storage and Clear data or uninstall the app. This will erase all locally stored data, OAuth, tokens, and credentials from your device.
