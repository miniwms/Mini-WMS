### Counting Options  
- You can count stock by selecting either:  
    - Item: Choose a specific item to count across all locations.  
    - Location: Go to a specific location and select it on the screen.  

### Update Stock  
- Once you select a location, the screen will display:  
    - The item(s) stored in that location.  
    - The quantity currently recorded in Mini-WMS.  
- If your physical count differs, you can update the system with the correct quantity.
