### Counting Options  
- You can count stock by selecting either:  
    - By Item: Click on the Item radio button, and choose a specific item from the **dropdown** or use the **barcode scanner** to load the itemloc details, then update the quantity if neccesary.  
    - By Location: Click on the Location radio button, and choose specific location from the dropdown locations to load the itemloc details, then update the quantity if neccesary.  

### Update Stock  
- Once you select a location, the screen will display:  
    - The item stored in that location.
    - If the item exists in multiple locations, then the location dropdown should show all the locations where this item exists.
    - The quantity currently recorded in Mini-WMS.  
- If your physical count differs, you can update the system with the correct quantity.
